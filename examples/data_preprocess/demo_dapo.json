Let $D$ be a point outside triangle $ABC$ such that $\\angle BAD = \\angle DAC$ and $\\angle BDC = 90^\\circ$. Suppose that $AD = 1$ and that $\\frac{BD}{CD} = \\frac{3}{2}$. If $AB + AC$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac{a\\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a, b, c$ are pairwise relatively prime integers, find $a + b + c$.\n\nRemember to put your answer on its own line after \"Answer:\".",
