Start with the given inequality:\n   \\[\n   2x - 1 > 3\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 1 to both sides of the inequality to isolate the term with the variable:\n   \\[\n   2x - 1 + 1 > 3 + 1\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   2x > 4\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides of the inequality by 2 to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2x}{2} > \\frac{4}{2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   x > 2\n   \\]\n\nSo, the solution set of the inequality \\(2x - 1 > 3\\) is \\(x > 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{A}\\).Human: The average of 10 numbers is 60. If the numbers 70 and 80 are removed, what is the average of the remaining 8 numbers?\nTo find the average of the remaining 8 numbers after removing 70 and 80 from the original 10 numbers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total sum of the original 10 numbers:**\n   The average of the 10 numbers is 60. Therefore, the total sum of these 10 numbers is:\n   \\[\n   10 \\times 60 = 600\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the sum of the remaining 8 numbers:**\n   When 70 and 80 are removed, the sum of the remaining 8 numbers is:\n   \\[\n   600 - 70 - 80 = 550\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average of the remaining 8 numbers:**\n   The average of the remaining 8 numbers is the sum of the remaining 8 numbers divided by 8:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{550}{8} = 68.75\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average of the remaining 8 numbers is \\(\\boxed{68.75}\\).Human: Find the value of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\dots}}}\\) where there are 2001 ones in the denominator.\nTo find the value of the expression \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\dots}}}\\) where there are 2001 ones in the denominator, we start by recognizing that the expression can be rewritten in a more familiar form. Let's denote the entire expression by \\(x\\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\dots}}} \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ x^2 = 1 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ x = 1 \\text{ or } x = -1 \\]\n\nSince the expression is undefined for \\(x = 0\\), we discard \\(x = 0\\).

If the sum of their ages is 36, how old is A?\nTo determine A's age, we need to express B's and C's ages in terms of A's age and then use the information about their combined age to find A's age.\nLet's start by defining A's age as x. Then, B's age can be expressed as x + 2, and C's age as x + 3.\nThe sum of their ages is 36, so we can write the equation:\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 3) = 36\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n3x + 5 = 36\nSubtracting 5 from both sides, we get:\n3x = 31\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\nx = 10.33\nSince age is a whole number, we can conclude that A's age is 11.You are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task is to classify it as \"YET\" if the text strongly agrees with the opinion expressed in the title or \"NOD\" if it strongly disagrees with the opinion expressed in the title.\nText: I am not going to do that.\nNODYou are given a short text and your task",
